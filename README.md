 ## About The Project

 **FindYourDance** is the culmination of my experience as a QA automation engineer. With over six months in the field, I've embraced the principles of project management and effective project structuring. This project is my canvas to apply these best practices and create a streamlined, efficient workflow.

 ### Goals

 - To provide an intuitive platform for discovering dance events.
 - To apply industry-standard project management techniques.
 - To implement a scalable and maintainable tech stack.

 ## Tech Stack

 Our technology choices are inspired by a desire to build a robust, scalable platform that can evolve over time:

 - **Backend**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for its scalable architecture and clean code structure.
 - **Frontend**: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to embrace modern React features and server-side rendering.
 - **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) initially locally hosted, with plans to migrate to AWS for increased scalability.
 - **UI Design**: Starting with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), with a roadmap to custom, reusable components.

 - **Third-Party APIs:** Leveraging powerful APIs such as Google Places for location-based services, goodpostcode for postal code validations, idchecks for identity verification, and Google Maps for mapping services.

 ## Testing

 - **Frontend Testing:** Utilizing React Testing Library to maintain robustness in our front-end code.
 - **Backend Testing:** Employing Jest for backend tests, reliability and tested.

 ## Code Quality

 - **Linting:** Code linting is enforced to maintain a high standard of code quality and consistency across the project.
 - **Husky:** Integrated to manage pre-commit hooks, ensuring that commits are clean and relevant.
